# Semantic parsing as machine translation

Most work on semantic parsing, even in variable-free formulations, has focused
on developing task- and formalism-specific models, often with expensive
training and decoding procedures. Can we use standard machine translation tools
to perform the same task? 

Yes. 

For a description of the system (it's really not complicated), see:
